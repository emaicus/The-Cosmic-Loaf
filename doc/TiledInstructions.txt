Please note, at present, an object layer rectangle should only be in one box at a time. We're working on it!

playerStart 
	Use - object layer.
	Defines player starting location 
	Accepted Value - "true"

collidable - 
	Use - object or tile layer.
	Determines whether or not a tile/entity can be bumped into.
	Accepted Value - "true"
	
Art
	Use - object layer.
	Determines which art a generated Entity is supposed to have.
	Accepted Value - "talker"
	NOTE: for now, this feature only accepts "talker," which places a static npc sprite.
	
interaction
	Use - object or tile layer
	Determines what type of interaction an entity is capable of.
	Accepted Values Readable sign- read~{line@}line
	Example: read~you are reading this@this is the second thing on the sign@This engine is wicked intuitive!
	Accepted Values Single Entity Dialog - talk~{audioFilePath.extension#EmotionType#Prompt#Subtitles@}
	Example: talk~pierre1.wav#neutral#Hate Newspapers#I HATE NEWSPAPERS@pierre2.wav#neutral#Scream at the sky#Ahhhhhh
	Accepted Values Two Entity Dialog - {talk2~initiatordialog.wav#initiator emotion#initiator subs#responderdialog.wav#responder emotion#prompt#responder subtitles@}
	Example: talk2~fletcher1.wav#angry#Will you shut up?#boyWithDog1.wav#happy#Tell the boy to go away#I dont know how to shut up!
	Sorry that this takes so long. :(
	
health
	Use - object layer 
	NOTE: working on adding destruction for tile layers. The problem at the moment is that "killing" a terrain results in a black void.
	Determines whether or not an entity has health, if it is invulnerable, and how much health it has.
	Accepted Value - booleanInvulnerable,HealthAmt
	Example: true,5
	The above results in an invulnerable entity with 5 health.


TRIGGERS:
NOTE: Lets keep triggers to one type; the engine isn't complete enough yet to allow a trigger to start on, say, one death, 
two activations, and an entry. Ask if you need this prioritized. Thanks!

triggeringEntity 
	Use - Object Layer
	States that this entity causes a named trigger to go off.
	Accepted value - 
	triggerName@("active" | anythingElse)@("startOnDeath" | "startOnConversation"@dialogNumberStartingAtZero | "startOnActivation")
	Example - trigger1@active@startOnDeath 
	The above says that trigger1 (whatever that is) is a trigger that goes off after this entity dies.

NOTE: I won't let a terrain square start on death. Please instead define the desired entity in the object layer. Thanks!

NOT YET SUPPORTED
triggeringSquare -
	Use - object layer (put it on a non collidable, non moving spot).
	Says that this square causes a trigger to go off.
	Accepted value - triggerName@("active" | anythingElse)@("startOnEntry" | "startOnExit")
	Example - trigger2@active@startOnEntry
	The above says that trigger2 goes off when an entity walks onto this tile.
WE'RE WORKING ON IT!

affectedEntity- 	
	Use Object or Terrain Layer
	Says that this object or terrain is affected by a named trigger.
	Accepted value - triggerName@harmsBoolean@healsBoolean@amount@activatesBoolean@("spawns" | "despawns")@executesScriptsBoolean@scriptName
	Example - trigger1@false,false,0,false,spawns,false,none
	The above (very nasty to read) trigger says that, when trigger one goes off, this entity will spawn. So, based on the example
	in triggeringEntity above, when that entity is killed, this entity will spawn. Wow, how marvelous are triggers.?
